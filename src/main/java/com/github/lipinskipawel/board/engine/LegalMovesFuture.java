/**
 * This class is an API.
 * This class is designed to be returned by the {@link Board#allLegalMovesFuture()} method. Clients are not permitted to
 * create instances of this class by themselves.
 * <p>
 * This class is capable of find all possible moves for a given {@link Board board}. This class will find even those
 * moves that result in ending the game instantaneously when played (for example by placing ball inside the corner).
 * Searching for all possible moves is described as computation in the javadoc of this class.
 * <p>
 * In order to start computation client <strong>MUST</strong> call {@link #start(Duration)} method with specified
 * duration. After this duration the computation will be stopped. Duration is required since board can be in computation
 * complex state where searching for all possible moves results in several thousands moves. Due to this inherent
 * complexity client must provide timeout.
 * <p>
 * During the computation the implementation saves already found moves in its state. Clients can access already found
 * moves during the computation. See {@link #partialResult()} method.
 * <p>
 * <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
 * There are three ways in which the computation will be stopped:
 * - completing the computation within given timeout
 * - running out of time due to exceeding given timeout
 * - canceling computation explicit by the caller ({@link #cancel()}
 *
 * <h2>Thread safety</h2>
 * This class is thread-safe. Any calls to its public API in concurrent way is understood as safe. Implementation does
 * not expose any lock for the client side locking.
